# Dart Null-Aware Operator Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential issue when using the null-aware operator (`??=`) with variables that might be null outside the scope of their initialization.  The `bug.dart` file shows a scenario where accessing a variable that could be null after a loop over an empty list results in a runtime error. The solution provided in `bugSolution.dart` explains how to mitigate the potential error.

## Setup

Clone the repository and run the `bug.dart` file using a Dart compiler. Observe the runtime error.
Then, run `bugSolution.dart` to see the corrected version.
